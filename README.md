# What is it?
This was a project I did to learn how to use SDL2 and C++. It only has a map editor really, as well as some basic animation running.

# How to use?
* WASD -> Moves camera
* Left Click -> places last loaded through 'typing mode' (dirt by default) tile
* Enter -> toggle 'typing mode' (type the name of an image in the Data folder)

# BTW
 you may have to use task manager to close it. I made this a long time ago and I probably didn't know how to make a program that can use the 'x' button.
